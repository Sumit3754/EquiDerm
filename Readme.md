Features
Instant AI Analysis: Upload a skin lesion image and receive an immediate classification from a trained Keras model.


Detailed Information: Get an in-depth, easy-to-understand overview of the predicted condition generated by the Gemini API, including symptoms, risk factors, and general treatment approaches.


User-Friendly Interface: A clean, intuitive, and responsive web application built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.


Built for Equity: A foundational step towards reducing health disparities caused by biased AI in digital health.

Technology Stack
The project is built on a mature and accessible technology stack, making it highly feasible and scalable.


Machine Learning & Data Science: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy 






Web Application & Gen-AI: Streamlit, Google Gemini API 




Core Language & Tools: Python, Matplotlib, Pip 





Dataset
This project is trained on the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.



Classes: The data is structured into 7 categories: Melanoma, Melanocytic Nevi, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Actinic Keratosis, Benign Keratosis-like Lesions, Dermatofibroma, and Vascular Lesions.

Download: You can download the dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

You can download keras model too from here to run this model -- https://keras.io/api/models/model/
and - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model 

*Currently we are not able to load this huge dataset around 8 gb and model so we are currently running it on our localhost and to get live demo we need enterprise plan to run this model.*

Installation & Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/equiderma.git
cd equiderma
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Dataset:

Download the HAM10000 dataset from the Kaggle link provided above.

Create a data/ directory and structure the images into train/ and validation/ subfolders according to the 7 classes.

Set up API Key:

Get your API key from Google AI Studio.

Add your key to the app.py script.

Run the application:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
Future Plans

Expand Knowledge: Integrate more diverse datasets to grow from 7 to over 27 conditions.


Clinical Validation: Partner with dermatologists and clinics to validate the model's performance on real-world clinical data.


Go Mobile: Develop a mobile application for iOS and Android to maximize accessibility.
