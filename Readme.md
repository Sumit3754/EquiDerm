Dataset
This project is trained on the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.



Classes: The data is structured into 7 categories: Melanoma, Melanocytic Nevi, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Actinic Keratosis, Benign Keratosis-like Lesions, Dermatofibroma, and Vascular Lesions.

Download: You can download the dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

Installation & Setup

Add your key to the app.py script.

Run the application:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
Future Plans

Expand Knowledge: Integrate more diverse datasets to grow from 7 to over 27 conditions.


Clinical Validation: Partner with dermatologists and clinics to validate the model's performance on real-world clinical data.


Go Mobile: Develop a mobile application for iOS and Android to maximize accessibility.
